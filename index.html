                            <p>After first beating Belgian boxer Yvon Becaus at the Rome Olympics in 1960, Ali went on to fight and win against Gennady Shatkov and Tony Madigan. He made the final against Poland's Zbigniew Pietrzykowski, much stronger and
                                more experienced than Ali, in which the judges decisions were unanimous. Ali won the Olympic gold medal. </p>

                                fined $10,000 and banned from boxing for three years.</p>
